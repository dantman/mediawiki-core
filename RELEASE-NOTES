Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== Version 1.3.8, 2004-11-15 ==

Changes from 1.3.4:

  cross-site scripting opportunity.


== Version 1.3.4, 2004-09-28 ==

************************** SECURITY NOTE! ******************************

As of 1.3.4, MediaWiki performs some screening of newly uploaded files for
validity. (Some)  corrupt image files, and HTML files mistakenly or
maliciously masquerading as images, should now be rejected.

These checks protect against Internet Explorer security holes relating
to type autodetection which are a potential cross-site scripting attack
vector, and also rejects at least one known version of the "JPEG virus"
which might attack unpatched clients.

If you already have invalid files uploaded this will not protect against
them. If you have expanded the filetype whitelist or disabled the strict
type checking, other dangerous file types may still get through. You should
always be careful when allowing uploads!


Changes from 1.3.3:
* Fixed lots of template-related bugs, esp. for cases where template
  variables are used for links, images, etc.
* Fixed transformation of page messages when viewing Special:Allmessages
* Handle "ISBN ISBN 1234" correctly
* Fixed warning on Category pages
* Fixed some bad error messages on login page
* Fixed history entry for initial main page on install
* Removed problematic { and } from legal title characters
* Strip leading blank from output in preformated text.
* Fixed problem when moving pages to titles with '#' in
* Optional $wgRawHtml for raw <html> sections. Use only on limited-
  participation 'trusted' wikis, as it does not protect against cross-site
  scripting attacks. For security, this option can only be enabled if in
  $wgWhitelistEdit mode.
* Fixed problem where pages which were created as a redirect following
  a move never showed on Special:Randompage.
* Fixed line spacing on printed table of contents
* Allow links to pages with names of the form [[RFC 1234]]
* Fixed broken edit links being shown for sections from included templates
* Verify that uploaded image files are of the claimed type.


== Version 1.3.3, 2004-09-09 ==

Changes from 1.3.2:

* Fix Go search for "0", numeric almost-self-links
* Avoid caching of pages with "You have new messages" headers

* Fix for $wgDebugDumpSql debug mode.
* $wgExtraNamespaces setting for configuring additional namespaces
  (see note in DefaultSettings.php)
* 'recache' on query pages now disabled when miser mode is on; special case the
  global settings in your LocalSettings.php to do automatic updates.
* Don't block UTF-8 titles containing byte 0xA0 (bug added in 1.3.2)
* Watch/unwatch tabs now shown on edit pages in MonoBook.
* Fix default skin in Irish localization (ga)
* Add Traditional Chinese localization (zh-tw)

  any longer

* Allow larger offsets for queries such as Special:Listusers
* Semicolon (;) added to French non-break space rules
* Possible fix for some install errors with path names permission problems.
* Removed [[Project:All system messages]], which has been superceded by
  the much faster [[Special:Allmessages]]. This speeds up installation
  considerably.

* More or less correct XHTML 1.0 (served as text/html by default)

Wiki features:
* Image captions can now include links and other basic formatting
* Image bounding box can be specified instead of width, e.g. as
  100x100px, making the image not wider than 100px and not higher
  than 100px, keeping aspect ratio.
* Templates have been expanded with parameters, and separated from
  the MediaWiki: localization scheme.
* Categories more or less work
* added a special page for listing users with sysop rights.

Editing:
* Automatic merging of edit conflicts that don't directly interfere

Optional modules:

Installation and upgrading:
* The old install.php and update.php have been removed. In-place
  installation introduced in 1.2 is now the standard installation
  and upgrade method, see INSTALL and UPGRADE for directions.

Database:
* The links table has been changed to use a cur_id for l_from.
  The link tables must be converted on upgrade, which may entail
  some downtime.

Code and compatibility:
* Should now run clean with error reporting set to E_ALL.
* register_globals hack from 1.2 has been replaced with safer code
* Bundled PHPTAL 0.7.0 from http://phptal.sourceforge.net/
  (with some patches)
* Most image-related code moved to Image.php
* More fixes for PHP 4.1.2 (thanks to Asheesh Laroia)
* URL encoding fix for anchors
* All languages now available in UTF-8 mode
* Various other fixes

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.
