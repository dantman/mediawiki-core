= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.

== Version 1.3.4, 2004-??-?? ==

Changes from 1.3.3:
* Fixed lots of template-related bugs, esp. for cases where template
  variables are used for links, images, etc.
* Fixed transformation of page messages when viewing Special:Allmessages
* Handle "ISBN ISBN 1234" correctly
* Fixed warning on Category pages
* Fixed some bad error messages on login page
* Fixed history entry for initial main page on install
* Removed problematic { and } from legal title characters
* Strip leading blank from output in preformated text.
* Fixed problem when moving pages to titles with '#' in
* Optional $wgRawHtml for raw <html> sections. Use only on limited-
  participation 'trusted' wikis, as it does not protect against cross-site
  scripting attacks. For security, this option can only be enabled if in
  $wgWhitelistEdit mode.
* Fixed problem where pages which were created as a redirect following
  a move never showed on Special:Randompage.
* Fixed line spacing on printed table of contents


== Version 1.3.3, 2004-09-09 ==

Changes from 1.3.2:
* Fix for long numeric page titles
* Fix Go search for "0", numeric almost-self-links
* Avoid caching of pages with "You have new messages" headers
* Fix for upgrades as non-root users from 1.2 command-line installs.
* Fix for $wgDebugDumpSql debug mode.
* $wgExtraNamespaces setting for configuring additional namespaces
  (see note in DefaultSettings.php)
* 'recache' on query pages now disabled when miser mode is on; special case the
  global settings in your LocalSettings.php to do automatic updates.
* Don't block UTF-8 titles containing byte 0xA0 (bug added in 1.3.2)
* Watch/unwatch tabs now shown on edit pages in MonoBook.
* Fix default skin in Irish localization (ga)
* Add Traditional Chinese localization (zh-tw)
* Changed default sortkey of subcategories. Don't include "Category:"-prefix
  any longer
* More helpful info on spam catcher.
* Allow larger offsets for queries such as Special:Listusers
* Semicolon (;) added to French non-break space rules
* Possible fix for some install errors with path names permission problems.
* Removed [[Project:All system messages]], which has been superceded by
  the much faster [[Special:Allmessages]]. This speeds up installation
  considerably.

== Version 1.3.2, 2004-08-30 ==

Changes from 1.3.1:
* Fix namespaced page creation links when no go match
* When cookies are disabled, don't show login screen twice

Changes from 1.3.0:

* Moved pages update watchlist correctly
* Fixed rebuildall.php on case-sensitive Unix filesystems

Look & layout:
* New default layout 'MonoBook' (available on PHP4 only currently)
* Print stylesheet now built-in to every page
* More or less correct XHTML 1.0 (served as text/html by default)

Wiki features:
* Image captions can now include links and other basic formatting
* Image bounding box can be specified instead of width, e.g. as
  100x100px, making the image not wider than 100px and not higher
  than 100px, keeping aspect ratio.
* Templates have been expanded with parameters, and separated from
  the MediaWiki: localization scheme.
* Categories more or less work
* added a special page for listing users with sysop rights.

Editing:
* Automatic merging of edit conflicts that don't directly interfere
* Edit summaries can now include basic formatting and links

Metadata and output:
* Linked Creative Commons copyright metadata (optional)
* RSS 2.0 & Atom 0.3 feeds for Recent Changes, New Pages

Optional modules:

* Timeline module can be added (separate download).
  Requires ploticus.
* TeX now has an experimental MathML output mode (incomplete!)

Installation and upgrading:
* The old install.php and update.php have been removed. In-place
  installation introduced in 1.2 is now the standard installation
  and upgrade method, see INSTALL and UPGRADE for directions.

Database:
* The links table has been changed to use a cur_id for l_from.
  The link tables must be converted on upgrade, which may entail
  some downtime.

Code and compatibility:
* Should now run clean with error reporting set to E_ALL.
* register_globals hack from 1.2 has been replaced with safer code
* Bundled PHPTAL 0.7.0 from http://phptal.sourceforge.net/
  (with some patches)
* Most image-related code moved to Image.php
* More fixes for PHP 4.1.2 (thanks to Asheesh Laroia)
* URL encoding fix for anchors
* All languages now available in UTF-8 mode
* Various other fixes

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)

The new 'MonoBook' skin is not compatible with PHP 5 due to bugs in the
underlying PHPTAL library. It will be automatically disabled when running
on PHP5; the older look and feel will be used instead.
