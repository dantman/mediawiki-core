= MediaWiki release notes =

Security reminder: MediaWiki does not require PHP's register_globals
setting since version 1.2.0. If you have it on, turn it *off* if you can.


== MediaWiki 1.4 BETA 6 ==

MediaWiki 1.4beta6 is a security and bug fix release for the 1.4 beta
series.

An attacker could craft a URL which, when visited by a particular
logged-in user, would execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the user's
browser in the wiki's site context. This attack has been blocked, and as
an extra precaution the user CSS and JavaScript subpage support is now
disabled by default. Sites which want this ability may set $wgAllowUserCss
and $wgAllowUserJs in LocalSettings.php.

Additional protections have been added against off-site form submissions
hijacking user credentials. Authors of bot tools may need to update their
code to include additional fields.

These problems affects the 1.3.x releases as well; 1.3 users should
upgrade to 1.3.10.

Note that 1.4 beta releases prior to beta 5 include an input validation
error which could lead to execution of arbitrary PHP code on the server.
Users of older betas should upgrade immediately to the current version.


Beta 6 also introduces the use of rel="nofollow" attributes on external
links in wiki pages to reduce the effectiveness of wiki spam. This will
cause participating search engines to ignore external URL links from wiki
pages for purposes of page relevancy ranking.

The current implementation adds this attribute to _all_ external URL
links in wiki text (but not internal [[wiki links]] or interwiki links).
To disable the attribute for _all_ external links, add this line to your
LocalSettings.php:

  $wgNoFollowLinks = false

This is a beta release; while most things are working, there are some
known problems and probably unknown problems. Don't run a public site
on this beta unless you're willing to help with investigating and
fixing any problems you encounter.

CARELESS USE OF THIS CODE MAY RENDER YOU STERILE, GROW WEEDS IN YOUR
YARD, AND FEED YOUR CAT TO A SEWER ALLIGATOR. DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T
WARNED, CAUSE WE WARNED YOU.

If upgrading from an older release, see the file UPGRADE;
1.4beta5 does include a minor database change from earlier betas.

=== New features ===

* 'Recentchanges Patrol' to mark new edits that haven't yet been viewed.
* New, searchable deletion/upload/protection logs
* Image gallery generation (Special:Newimages and <gallery> tag)
* SVG rasterization support (requires external support)
* Users can select from the available localizations to override the
  default user interface language.
* Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion support

=== Installation and compatibility ===

* The default MonoBook theme now works with PHP 5.0
* Installation on systems with PHP's safe mode or other oddities
  should work more reliably, as MonoBook no longer needs to
  create a compiled template file for the wiki to run.
* A table prefix may be specified, to avoid conflicts with other
  web applications forced to share a database.
* More thorough UTF-8 input validation; fixes non-ASCII uploaded
  filenames from Safari.
* Command-line database upgrade script.

=== Customizability ===

* Default user options can now be overridden in LocalSettings.
* Skins system more modular: templates and CSS are now in /skins/
  New skins can be dropped into this directory and used immediately.
* More extension hooks have been added.
* Authentication plugin hook.
* More internal code documentation, generated with phpdoc:
  http://www.mediawiki.org/docs/html/

=== Optimization ===

* For many operations, MediaWiki 1.4 should run faster and use
  less memory than MediaWiki 1.3. Page rendering is up to twice
  as fast. (Use a PHP accelerator such as Turck MMCache for best
  results with any PHP application, though!)
* The parser cache no longer requires memcached, and is enabled
  by default. This avoids a lot of re-rendering of pages that
  have been shown recently, greatly speeding longer page views.
* Support for compiled PHP modules to speed up page diff and
  Unicode validation/normalization. (Requires ability to compile
  and load PHP extensions).

=== What isn't ready yet ===

* A new user/groups permissions scheme has been held back to 1.5.
* An experimental SOAP interface will be made available as an extension
* PostgreSQL support is largely working, but search and installer
  support are not complete. These are being actively worked on
  and should come in later betas.
* E-mail notification of watched page changes and verification of
  user-submitted e-mail addresses is not yet included. If updates
  are available, this may make it into later betas.
* Log pages are not automatically imported into the new log table
  at upgrade time. A script to import old text log entries is
  incomplete, but may be available by the time 1.4 finishes.
* UI messages may be broken in Latin-1 mode in this release due to some
  minor breakage in the language selection module.

=== Misc bugs fixed in beta 1 ===

=== Caveats ===

Some output, particularly involving user-supplied inline HTML, may not
produce 100% valid or well-formed XHTML output. Testers are welcome to
set $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml"; to test for remaining problem
cases, but this is not recommended on live sites. (This must be set for
MathML to display properly in Mozilla.)
