== Upgrading from 1.3.x betas ==

Should generally go smoothly.

Note that 1.3 betas prior to beta 6 included a potential vulnerability
if PHP is configured with register_globals on and the includes directory
is available. For general safety, turn register_globals *off* if you don't
_really_ need it for another package.

If your hosting provider turns it on and you can't turn it off yourself,
send them a kind note explaining that it can expose their servers and their
customers to attacks.


== Upgrading from 1.2.x ==

If you've been using the MediaWiki: namespace for custom page templates,
note that things are a little different. The Template: namespace has been
added which is more powerful -- templates can include parameters for
instance.

Any MediaWiki: entries that are not used by the software will be automatically
moved to Template: entries at upgrade time. Be sure to go through and check
that everything is working properly.

Also, be sure to pick the correct character encoding -- some languages were
only available in Latin-1 on 1.2.x and are now available for Unicode as well.
If you want to upgrade an existing wiki from Latin-1 to Unicode you'll have
to dump the database to SQL, run it through iconv or another conversion tool,
and restore it. Sorry.


== Upgrading from 1.1.x or earlier ==

This is less thoroughly tested, but should work.

You need to specify the *admin* database username and password to the
installer in order for it to successfully upgrade the database structure.
You may wish to manually change the GRANTs later.


== Upgrading from UseModWiki or old "phase 2" Wikipedia code ==

There is an unmaintained UseModWiki to MediaWiki conversion script at
maintenance/importUseModWiki.php; it may require tweaking and customization
to work for you.

Install a new MediaWiki first, then use the conversion script which will
output SQL statements; direct these to a file and then run that into your
database.

You will have to rebuild the links tables etc after importing.
